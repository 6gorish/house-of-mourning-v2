## vigorish
*Visual Artist, Sound Design, Video, Interactive Development*

vigorish is a multidisciplinary artist whose work explores contemplative and transcendental experience in contemporary contexts. Drawing on an academic background in music and a professional career in technology, VI works fluidly across audio, video, code, language, and visual media. The practice builds on traditions of composition, sampling, and assemblage to create layered, immersive environments that invite reflection and emotional depth. For *The House of Mourning*, VI developed the generative soundscape and video, designed the interactive constellation visualization, and created the technical infrastructure allowing visitor contributions to become part of the living installation.
