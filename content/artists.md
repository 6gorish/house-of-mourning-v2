# Producers / Curators

## Two Flaneurs
*Producer, Curator*

Two Flaneurs is an art collective founded by Lee Knight and VI Gorish, working at the intersections of music, audio, and visual media to explore transcendental experience in contemporary, secular contexts. Drawing on traditions of sacred aesthetics while filtering them through queer and neurodivergent perspectives, Two Flaneurs creates immersive installations and performance events that honor grief, ritual, and collective witness. Their practice asks what sacred space looks like when divorced from inherited belief systems—how technology and art can become transparent enough that viewers encounter previously unaware aspects of their own interiority. Previous collaborative work includes Their Haus (2019), a multidisciplinary performance event that transformed raw space into sanctuary for queer creative expression.

## Kawaji
*Musician*
**image:** kawaji.jpg

Kawaji is a Portland, ME-based selector specializing in underground UK bass music, dubstep, and dub techno. With a background in jazz bass performance, he brings a musician's ear to his curation, building sets that honor the deep, contemplative qualities of 140 bpm bass music. He hosts a regular show on Sub FM, the London-based underground bass music station, every other Tuesday, where he explores the shadowy territories between dub techno's hypnotic minimalism and UK dubstep's weighted low-end. He acquired his moniker  during years spent living in South Sudan before independence, where distance from Western club culture helped him develop an idiosyncratic approach to electronic sound. For The House of Mourning's opening reception, Kawaji will provide a sonic backdrop that mirrors the exhibition's contemplative atmosphere—bass-heavy, immersive, and designed for deep listening.

## Valerie Tamplin
*Visual Artist*
**image:** valerie-tamplin.jpg

Maine painter Valerie Tamplin (b. 1942) creates abstract and representational works that address timeless opposing forces in nature and the complexity of the human form. Working in oil, acrylic, watercolor, and assemblage, she explores New England coastal landscapes as expressions of elemental tensions, while rendering the body—at rest, in motion, grappling—with classical anatomical precision learned from Robert Beverly Hale. Her compositions juxtapose pattern, texture, and color, with palettes ranging from monochromatic abstractions to blue-dominated figurative paintings. Recurring curvilinear forms create rhythmic continuity across her diverse subjects. Tamplin's work appears in regional exhibitions and private collections nationally, with permanent installations in Brunswick, Maine.
