# Producers / Curators

## Lee Knight
*Producer, Curator*

Lee Knight is a multidisciplinary artist and curator working at the intersections of visual art, music, and experiential production. Lee curated exhibitions at 18th Street Arts Center in Santa Monica and led curatorial initiatives at SuperRare, working with emerging digital artists exploring themes of identity, ritual, and narrative. As Event Production Manager for ETHDenver, Lee produced large-scale creative programming integrating immersive art and performance with cutting-edge technology. As Black Wolf, Lee performs genre-defying electronic music and audiovisual works rooted in grief, resilience, and collective transformation. Previous work includes *Their Haus* (2019), a multidisciplinary performance event that transformed raw space into immersive sanctuary for drag, live music, and queer creative expression, praised for its intimacy, inclusivity, and emotional power.

## VI Gorish
*Sound Design, Video, Interactive Development*

VI Gorish is a multidisciplinary artist whose work explores contemplative and transcendental experience in contemporary contexts. Drawing on an academic background in music and a professional career in technology, VI works fluidly across audio, video, code, language, and visual media. The practice builds on traditions of composition, sampling, and assemblage to create layered, immersive environments that invite reflection and emotional depth. For *The House of Mourning*, VI developed the generative soundscape and video, designed the interactive constellation visualization, and created the technical infrastructure allowing visitor contributions to become part of the living installation.
