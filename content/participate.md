# Guidelines

Your submission will be visible to visitors at the physical installation and on this website. We ask that you:

- Keep messages under 280 characters
- Be honest—this is a space for authentic expressions of grief
- Be respectful—this is a shared memorial space
- Understand that messages become part of a public artwork

Messages containing spam, harassment, or content clearly unrelated to mourning will be removed. We trust you to honor the space and other visitors.

# Privacy & How Your Data Is Used

**Anonymity:** We do not collect email addresses, IP addresses, phone numbers, or other identifying information through this form.

**Public Display:** Messages are displayed publicly as part of the installation—both at Truss House during December 19-20 and on this website as an ongoing archive.

**Moderation:** We review submissions to prevent abuse. We won't reject grief that's raw, angry, or difficult—but we will remove spam, harassment, and content that violates the space's intention.

**Removing Your Message:** Messages become part of the permanent artwork and archive. If you need a message removed, contact admin@thehouseofmourning.com with the exact text of your submission.

# After You Submit

Your message appears in the installation within moments. If you're visiting Truss House, you'll see your words join the generative visualization and soundscape. Your contribution connects with others through semantic similarity—the system identifies resonances between expressions, revealing unexpected kinships between different griefs.

You won't be able to easily identify your specific message in the visualization. That anonymity is intentional. Your grief joins others. It finds company in strangers' words. Individual losses reveal patterns. What felt singular discovers it's part of something larger.

Thank you for trusting this space with what you're carrying.
