# After You Submit

Your message appears in the installation within moments. If you're visiting Truss House during December 19-20, you'll see your words join the living visualization and soundscape. Your contribution connects with others through semantic similarity—the system identifies resonances between expressions, revealing unexpected kinships between different griefs.

You won't be able to easily identify your specific message in the visualization. That anonymity is intentional. Your grief joins others. It finds company in strangers' words. Individual losses reveal patterns. What felt singular discovers it's part of something larger.

Thank you for trusting this space with what you're carrying.

# Guidelines

Your submission will be visible to visitors at the physical installation and on this website. We ask that you:

- Keep messages under 280 characters
- Be honest—this is a space for authentic expressions of grief
- Be respectful—this is a shared memorial space
- Understand that messages become part of a public artwork

Messages containing spam, harassment, or content clearly unrelated to mourning will be removed. We trust you to honor the space and other visitors.
