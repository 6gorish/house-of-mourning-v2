# Introduction

Grief can feel like the loneliest experience. We carry our losses as if they're singular, incomprehensible to anyone else. Yet when we create space to witness mourning together—not to fix it, not to rush past it, but simply to be present with it—something shifts.

*The House of Mourning* transforms Truss House into a sanctuary for personal and collective reflection. Mixed-media works by artists explore a secular iconography of grief, drawing on the visual language of mourning—ritual, religious iconography, gothic aesthetics—while filtering it through contemporary perspectives. A data-driven generative soundscape and video installation invites you to offer your own expressions of loss, making your personal mourning part of the collective experience.

On Saturday evening, the contemplative space becomes a performance venue. Poets bring voice and embodied presence through spoken word. Musicians transform the space from static memorial into living ritual through experimental sound and sonic landscapes. Together, we create a collective iconography that honors grief's inevitability and necessity.

Enter, witness, contribute—and discover what mourning reveals when it's no longer hidden.
