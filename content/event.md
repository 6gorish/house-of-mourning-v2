# What to Expect

**Visit Duration:** Plan for 20-40 minutes with the exhibition, though you're welcome to stay longer. Saturday evening performances run several hours (specific schedule TBD).

**The Experience:**
- Move through mixed-media installations exploring grief, memory, and resilience
- Experience a generative soundscape and video responding to visitor contributions  
- Interact with the installation—read others' expressions of loss, contribute your own
- Saturday evening: witness poetry and music performances transforming the space into living ritual

**Photography Policy:** Personal photography welcome. Please be respectful of other visitors and performers. Flash photography discouraged during performances. Social media sharing encouraged—tag #TheHouseOfMourning.

**Guidelines:**
- This is a contemplative space; respectful quiet appreciated
- Conversation is fine; loud talking less so
- Messages you contribute will be visible to all visitors
- Touch artwork only where explicitly invited
