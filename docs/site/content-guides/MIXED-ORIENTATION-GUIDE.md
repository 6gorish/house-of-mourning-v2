# Artist Headshots: Mixed Orientation Guide

## The Solution: Museum Curation Principles

Instead of forcing all images into one rigid size, we use gallery principles:
- **Consistent maximum dimensions** (not fixed dimensions)
- **Centered alignment** 
- **Generous negative space**
- **Subtle visual treatment** (grayscale, shadow)

The result: Intentional variation that feels curated, not chaotic.

## Processing Guidelines by Orientation

### Portrait Images (Height > Width)

1. Resize longer edge to 800px, maintain aspect ratio
2. Reduce saturation by 20-30%
3. Export as JPG, quality 85%

**Display:** Max 320px wide × 500px tall

### Landscape Images (Width > Height)

1. Resize longer edge to 800px, maintain aspect ratio
2. Reduce saturation by 20-30%
3. Export as JPG, quality 85%

**Display:** Max 320px wide × 400px tall

### Square Images (Width ≈ Height)

1. Resize to 600×600
2. Reduce saturation by 20-30%
3. Export as JPG, quality 85%

**Display:** Max 320px × 320px

## Visual Harmony Principles

Even with mixed orientations, the page maintains elegance through:

1. **Consistent Column Width:** Image column is always 320px
2. **Centered Alignment:** All images centered in their container
3. **Visual Treatment:** All images get same grayscale + hover effect
4. **Spacing:** Generous margins between artist profiles
5. **Typography:** Consistent font treatment across all artists

## Testing Different Orientations

When testing, verify:

- [ ] Portrait images display at appropriate width (not too wide)
- [ ] Landscape images display at appropriate height (not too tall)
- [ ] Square images display nicely
- [ ] All images are centered in their column
- [ ] Grayscale effect applies to all
- [ ] Hover effect works on all
- [ ] No image appears distorted or stretched
- [ ] Page maintains visual cohesion despite mixed orientations

## Key Takeaway

**Don't force crops.** Let images maintain their natural composition. The component automatically handles display based on orientation, creating a curated gallery aesthetic rather than a rigid grid.

This approach is more professional than forcing everything into identical dimensions - it respects the photographer's original composition while maintaining visual cohesion.
