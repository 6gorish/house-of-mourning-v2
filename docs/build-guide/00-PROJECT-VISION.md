# House of Mourning: Project Vision & Creative Brief

**Exhibition Dates**: December 19-20, 2025  
**Location**: Truss House, Denver  
**Last Updated**: November 12, 2025

---

## Core Concept

**House of Mourning** is an interactive art installation that reveals the hidden interconnectedness of human grief. Individual experiences of loss, submitted as brief text messages, become luminous particles in a shared constellation—a universe where seemingly isolated moments of mourning discover unexpected kinship through semantic resonance.

The work invites contemplation: grief feels profoundly personal, yet the patterns that emerge when hundreds of experiences coexist suggest a deeper truth about our common humanity. Like stars in a night sky, each message maintains its individual presence while contributing to a larger pattern that only becomes visible when seen as a collective whole.

## The Experience

### For Exhibition Visitors

Visitors encounter a large-scale projection showing a field of gently glowing particles, each representing one person's grief. The particles breathe independently—some bright, some dim, some pulsing slowly, others faster—creating a living, meditative atmosphere.

Periodically, ephemeral connections form between particles, revealing messages that share semantic similarity despite being written by different people at different times. These connection clusters appear as delicate webs of light, holding for a few moments before dissolving, only to reform elsewhere in the constellation.

The system traverses this universe through these connections: one message becomes the focus, connected messages surround it, and then the system flows to the next, creating a continuous contemplative journey through the landscape of collective loss.

Visitors can:
- **Observe**: Watch the autonomous system reveal connections
- **Explore**: Hover over any particle to read its message
- **Contribute**: Submit their own grief to join the constellation

### For Remote Participants

The installation includes SMS integration, allowing people unable to attend physically to text their grief and see it appear in the live visualization within moments. This extends the constellation beyond the gallery walls, making it a truly collective work.

### After the Exhibition

The website becomes an archive: a record of all submitted messages, documentation of the event, and potentially a continued live visualization allowing the constellation to grow over time.

## Aesthetic Principles

### Visual Language

The design must embody **contemplative restraint**—the visual equivalent of a moment of silence, a memorial, a space held open for reflection.

**Reference Points**:
- **White Cube galleries**: Gagosian, David Zwirner (generous space, minimal distraction)
- **Museum websites**: MoMA, Tate Modern, Guggenheim (sophisticated, information-rich without clutter)
- **Luxury contemplative brands**: Aesop, Byredo, The Row (quality over ornamentation, confidence in simplicity)
- **Memorial spaces**: Vietnam Veterans Memorial, 9/11 Memorial (dignity, individual + collective presence)

**What This Means in Practice**:
- **Generous white space**: Let the content breathe
- **Restrained typography**: One or two fonts, used with precision
- **Muted color palette**: Primarily neutral (grays, off-whites), with intentional accent for interactive elements
- **Subtle animation**: Nothing jarring or playful—everything serves contemplation
- **High signal-to-noise ratio**: Every element has purpose
- **Respect for content**: Grief is not entertainment; the design honors its weight

### Typography Approach

Typography should feel:
- **Timeless**: Not trendy, could exist in 10 years without feeling dated
- **Elegant**: Letter-spacing, line-height, and hierarchy carefully considered
- **Legible**: Especially for grief messages—readability is respect
- **Authoritative but warm**: Museum-quality without being cold

**Candidates to consider**:
- **Futura**: Geometric, clean, has exhibition pedigree (Wes Anderson films, VW, Supreme)
- **Helvetica Neue**: Classic, neutral, museum standard
- **Circular or GT America**: Contemporary alternatives with warmth
- **Serif option for body**: Crimson Pro, Source Serif, or similar for longer reading

### Color Psychology

The visualization itself uses blues, purples, and teals—colors associated with:
- Night sky (constellation metaphor)
- Contemplation and depth
- Sadness without being depressing
- Coolness (emotional, not trendy)

The marketing site should complement this with:
- **Warm neutrals**: Off-white (#F5F5F0), warm grays
- **Dark text**: Near-black (#1A1A1A), not pure black
- **Accent**: Possibly a deep teal or muted gold for interactive elements
- **Visualization background**: True black (#000000) to make particles luminous

## Interactive Visualization Requirements

### Visual Characteristics

**Must match production aesthetic**:
- Particles: Varied sizes (based on message length, emotion intensity)
- Colors: Blues, purples, teals (grief-appropriate palette)
- Alpha oscillation: Independent breathing for each particle (4-20 second periods)
- Connection lines: Delicate, organic curves (billowing quality)
- Fade animations: Smooth, contemplative transitions

**Behavioral Requirements**:
- **Constant universe**: 400 particles always visible
- **Semantic connections**: Related messages grouped in ephemeral clusters
- **Traversal**: System flows from one cluster to next (next message becomes focus)
- **Particle cycling**: As messages are displayed in clusters, they exit and new messages enter
- **Priority for new submissions**: Recent submissions appear quickly (within 3 cluster cycles)
- **Database coverage**: System cycles through entire database, then recycles

**Performance Requirements**:
- 60fps minimum
- Memory stable (<250MB for visualization)
- No crashes during 8+ hour exhibition days
- Graceful degradation if load is high

**Accessibility Considerations**:
- Hover to read (tooltip shows full message)
- Keyboard navigation (if feasible)
- Screen reader support for submission form (visualization itself may not be screen-reader accessible, but this should be noted)

## Content Strategy

### Voice & Tone

**Marketing site copy**:
- **Tone**: Contemplative, not mournful. Sophisticated, not pretentious.
- **Voice**: First-person plural ("we invite you", "our shared experience")
- **Approach**: Honor the gravity of grief without being heavy-handed
- **Style**: Clear, direct sentences. Avoid jargon. Poetic where appropriate, but never obscure.

**Example tone**:
> "Grief can feel like the loneliest experience. Yet when we gather these individual moments of loss, patterns emerge. Messages written by strangers, separated by time and circumstance, discover unexpected kinship. This installation reveals those hidden connections, inviting us to witness grief not as isolation, but as a constellation of shared humanity."

**Avoid**:
- Clinical/academic language ("The installation interrogates...")
- Overly sentimental language ("A beautiful journey of healing...")
- Tech-speak ("Using natural language processing algorithms...")
- Presumptuous claims ("You will feel less alone...")

**Aim for**:
- Honest, open invitations
- Specific, concrete descriptions
- Respect for visitor's own interpretation
- Acknowledgment of grief's complexity

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Visualization crashes during exhibition**
   - Mitigation: Extensive load testing, auto-restart on crash, backup visualization recording
   - Plan B: Static video loop if live system fails

2. **Database fills with spam/abuse**
   - Mitigation: Rate limiting, profanity filter, moderation queue, admin tools ready
   - Plan B: Disable submissions temporarily, moderate retroactively

3. **High load slows visualization**
   - Mitigation: Surge mode built into pool manager, memory limits enforced
   - Plan B: Reduce particle count temporarily

### Content Risks

1. **Offensive/inappropriate submissions**
   - Mitigation: Automated filtering, admin dashboard for quick removal
   - Plan B: Disable realtime updates, moderate before display

2. **Low submission volume**
   - Mitigation: Seed database with artist/team submissions, promote SMS option
   - Plan B: Visualization still beautiful with fewer messages

3. **Copy not finalized in time**
   - Mitigation: Start writing immediately, prioritize homepage and about page
   - Plan B: Minimal copy (title + dates + CTA) can launch, expand later

## Open Questions to Resolve

1. **Admission**: Is the exhibition free, ticketed, or suggested donation?
2. **SMS number**: Do we have a Twilio number secured?
3. **Readings/Performances**: Will there be any live programming during the exhibition?
4. **Photography policy**: Can visitors photograph the installation?
5. **Post-exhibition visualization**: Keep it live permanently, or archive only?
6. **Artist bios**: Do we have these written?
7. **Press/Marketing**: Who is handling outreach to press, social media, etc.?
