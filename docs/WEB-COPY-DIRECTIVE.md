## Voice & Tone Requirements

### Tone Characteristics

**Contemplative, not mournful**
- Honor the gravity of grief without being heavy-handed
- Respectful silence, not oppressive sadness
- Space for reflection, not prescription of emotion

**Sophisticated, not pretentious**
- Museum-quality writing (MoMA, Tate, Guggenheim)
- Accessible to general audience
- Avoid academic jargon or art-world insider language

**Warm authority**
- First-person plural: "we invite you", "our shared experience"
- Confident but never presumptuous
- Professional but human

### Writing Style

**Sentence structure**:
- Clear, direct statements
- Vary length for rhythm (short impactful sentences mixed with longer flowing ones)
- Avoid subordinate clauses piling up
- Poetic where appropriate, but never obscure

**Word choice**:
- Concrete, specific language over abstract concepts
- Strong verbs (reveal, emerge, discover) over weak verbs + adverbs
- "Grief" not "loss" (more direct)
- "Messages" not "submissions" (more human)

**Paragraph structure**:
- Each paragraph = one clear idea
- Topic sentence, development, conclusion
- White space between paragraphs (web readability)

---

## Example Tone Reference

**GOOD EXAMPLE** (contemplative, sophisticated, warm):
> "Grief can feel like the loneliest experience. Yet when we gather these individual moments of loss, patterns emerge. Messages written by strangers, separated by time and circumstance, discover unexpected kinship. This installation reveals those hidden connections, inviting us to witness grief not as isolation, but as a constellation of shared humanity."

**AVOID - Too Academic**:
> "The installation interrogates the phenomenology of collective mourning through algorithmic mediation, creating a site of encounter where participant narratives are subjected to computational analysis that reveals latent semantic affinities."

**AVOID - Too Sentimental**:
> "Join us on a beautiful healing journey as we come together to share our stories and find comfort in community. Your grief matters, and together we can transform pain into hope and light."

**AVOID - Too Technical**:
> "Using natural language processing algorithms, the system analyzes submitted text for semantic similarity, generating connection clusters that visualize related content through particle-based rendering in real-time."

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Grief is treated with appropriate gravity
- [ ] Information is concrete and specific (not vague)

- [ ] Artist bios are accurate and respectful
- [ ] Character limits respected where specified

---

## Revision Process

After generating initial copy:

1. Read aloud - does it sound natural?
2. Check length - is anything too long for web?
3. Verify facts - are all details correct?
4. Test tone - sophisticated but accessible?
5. Consider user journey - does copy guide visitor through site?

---

## Example Workflow

When you receive this directive:

1. **Review input materials** provided
2. **Ask clarifying questions** if information is missing
3. **Generate copy page by page** (start with homepage, then about, then event, then artists, then submit)
4. **Provide alternatives** where helpful (2-3 versions of hero text, for example)
5. **Include meta descriptions** for SEO
6. **Note any assumptions** you had to make (so they can be verified)

---

## Final Note: Respect for Grief

This is not marketing copy. This is not entertainment. People will submit real grief—parents who lost children, children who lost parents, people mourning partners, friends, pets, futures that won't happen.

The copy must:
- Honor that weight
- Create space for contemplation
- Never instrumentalize grief for "engagement"
- Invite without pressuring
- Acknowledge without presuming

If you find yourself writing something that sounds like it could be for any other art exhibition, stop. This is about mourning. The copy should reflect that specificity and gravity.

- Is SMS feature confirmed and number secured?
- Any COVID/health protocols to mention?
